# Icons

The `icons` folder because for some reason uswds-compile initialization requires this folder to be here.

If the `public` folder should be somewhere else on the file system (set through the environment variable) then this folder path (i.e. `<AXUM_ASSETS_FILE_DIR>/assets/icons`) should exist or else the server will throw an error on startup.
