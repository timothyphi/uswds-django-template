# Assets

## Why?

Because for some reason `uswds` needs their fonts and images to have the paths `public/images` and `public/fonts` directories for their stuff. Sooooo... until I can figure out how I can change that (so I can avoid source controlling all of their stuff), please put all of OUR OWN custom assets (images, fonts, etc.) in this directory.
